# 💳 Budget Breeze

Code that can be deployed to your Investec Programmable Card to help keep your transactions in check.

- It allows you to control how much you spend by setting expense categories (eg. groceries), assigning transactions per category (eg. woolworths)  and setting environment variables (eg. groceries limit =100)  to control your  spend per category
- Budget Breeze uses the [Investec Programmable Cards](https://developer.investec.com/za/programmable-card)
- You can now use the API to update environment variables for your programmable card without [deploying new code via the Investec IDE](https://developer.investec.com/za/api-products/documentation)

## ☑️ Requirements

- Access to the [Investec Programmable Banking API and Investec Online IDE](https://developer.investec.com/za/api-products)
- Ensure you familiarize yourself with [Investec Programmable Cards](https://offerzen.gitbook.io/programmable-banking-community-wiki/get-started/card-quick-start-guide)

## 🔑 Preparations

- Set your categories in the `categories` method within the `main.js` file
- Set your environment variables in the `env.json` file which will be used to control the spend per category

This will be done via the Investec Online IDE

## 🚀 Getting Started

The function inside the `main.js` file is used to replace the `beforeTransaction` function from within the Programmable Cards IDE on Investec Online. You will also need to copy the `categories` method and the `getCategory` method.
